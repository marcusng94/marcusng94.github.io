I"ø<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in Malaysia with multi-cultural background. I was a competitive swimmer throughout my teenage 
years and a house captain at Sri Cempaka, Malaysia. I went to a boarding college, KYUEM, Malaysia to pursue my A-levels
before applying for university. Upon completion of my A-levels, I went to the University of Glasgow, UK to study BSc in
Biochemistry. Half way through my undergraduate degree, I grew an interest in Chemistry and was offered a MSci in 
Chemistry, which I took up the offer. During my placement year, I was fortunate enough to be in KCC, KAUST, Saudi 
Arabia and I was given the opportunity to work on renewable energy technology, electrocatalysis for water-splitting in
particular. After that I started a summer internship in UofG and worked on energy storage materials for my final year 
Masterâ€™s project. Upon graduation, I started my PhD in University of Glasgow.</p>
