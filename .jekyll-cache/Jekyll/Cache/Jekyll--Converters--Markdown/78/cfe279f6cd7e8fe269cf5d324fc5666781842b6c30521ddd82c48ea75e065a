I"H<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in Malaysia with multi-cultural background. I was a competitive swimmer throughout my teenage 
years and a house captain in Sri Cempaka. I went to a boarding college (KYUEM) to pursue my A-levels before university. Upon completion of my A-levels, I went to
the University of Glasgow to study BSc in Biochemistry. Half way through my undergraduate degree, I grew an interest in
Chemistry and was offered a MSci in Chemistry, which I took up the offer.</p>
