## Introduction
In order to match the target reduction in CO2 emission and limit global warming to two degree Celsius in this century, 
conscious decision to leave fossil fuels in the ground must be taken. Energy generated from most of the renewable sources
are in the form of electrical energy, thus it is clear that electrochemical energy-storage devices hold promises towards 
this goal.

## Main research questions
Molecular metal oxides are excellent candidates for the next generation energy storage materials owing to their electrochemical, 
thermal and chemical stability which is essential when it comes to energy storage. However, due to the multi-components
system that are susceptible to factors  such as pH, temperature, concentration, compositions, etc. It becomes clear that 
rational design of molecule with desired properties may not be intuitive to human and/or may take a long time. Could we
then couple robotics and machine-learning to work in a closed-loop manner to syntheise molecular metal oxides with 
optimal properties for energy conversion/storage?
