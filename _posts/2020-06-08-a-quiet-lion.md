title: "A quiet lion is more dangerous than a barking dog"
excerpt: "Is this statement true at all?"

I came across [this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brittany-churchey-keith_quiet-leadership-listeningskills-activity-6667578190275469312-ea0B/) 
post recently and the quote *A quiet lion is more dangerous than a barking dog* came across my mind and I was wondering
"is this statement true at all?". Fortunately/unfortunately we seemed to live in a society where the person that shouts
the loudest seemed to win. Some had gained from it while others' voice seemed to be forgotten in the sea of noise. <br/>
A more recent heartbroken example to highlight the fact that our society had shaped us to *bark* (as that's the only way to be heard) 
is the protest [BLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter) movement. The point that I want to highlight here
is that human tend to dismiss/ brushoff concerns when spoken nicely. It always seemed that the aggressors always win. 
Wouldn't it be great if we as collective humans could spend more time listening, understanding and take actions towards 
the concerns raised by others? <br/>
It feels as though we always need some sort of extreme events to occur in order for us to pay attention to the other
side of the table. <br/>
There was a twitter-storm in the academia world last week where a P.I. published an essay on his thoughts regarding 
the whole equality and diversity has done to the field of organic chemistry. Upon reading the essay multiple times, if I 
were to summarise what he wrote in a sentence is that: Equality and diversity had decreased the quality of science. 
Obviously this is an over simplification and there is more to it (send me a message if you're interested reading the
original article); as it was taken down by the journal 3 hours after it was online. A line that stood out to me the most
was *"there must be unconditional submission of the apprentice to his/her master"*. In my opinion, that is the reason 
for the development of mental illness amongst PhD students have increased from 29 % (2017) to 36 % (2019) [(from this survey)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03489-1).
Most students that decided to undertake PhD/Doctoral studies didn't do it because they want to be rich and famous, we
do it because we are passionate about making a change (even in the slightest way possible), and a lot of us (including myself)
fell into the trap of *impostor syndrome*. A PhD student with impostor syndrome + an ill mannered mentor/ supervisor 
= disaster. The student will just fall into this constant negative feedback loop and down the rabbit hole. The worst
part is that most of the time the student doesn't even realise. To give an analogy, a couple in an abusive relationship
to which the girl/guy justifies her/his ill behaviour saying "but you don't know him/her, he/she doesn't always behave 
this way". As an outsider it is quite clear that the person is suffering from an abusive relationship but it takes courage
and supportive friends/family to realise that. <br/>
I suppose I went a little off-topic, but my point is that we as individual need to speak out for ourselves when injustice 
was done, do not suffer in silence.
