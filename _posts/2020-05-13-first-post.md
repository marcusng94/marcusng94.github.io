title: "First website"
excerpt: "I have finally gathered my courage to make a personal website."

Creating a website seemed like a daunting tasks especially for a person like myself without any background or any 
"computer wizards" in my extended family. <br/>
I am certain that the idea of having a personal website has came across into most people's mind but "where do I start?",
"don't I need a professional website designer and/or programmer to do such a difficult tasks?" are the questions that
I've always asked myself. <br/>
I was fortunate enough to have a *post-doc*  [Juanma](https://www.juanma.io/) who have suggested "Why don't you try 
Jekyll? You can write the posts and most of the things in markdown format". I had a look and started/attempted to make 
it with Jekyll, but it was still a bit challenging for me with all the layouts and I just wanted a nice simple layout
that I can just plug and go. <br/>
So I did what most people who started out programming do, I looked into github and just try to clone and edit what's 
available out there, and in this case it's Juanma's website. He had adopted his layout from minimal-mistakes and I have 
adopted my layout from his layout. #thecircleoflife <br/>
In any case, I hope he doesn't mind me doing it and perhaps he'll never find out about my personal website.
